Django ORM Project

This project uses the Django Framework to demonstrate the use of Django’s Object-Relational Mapper for managing database interactions.
It is designed to operate without running a full Django web server, focusing on database functionality, models, and data manipulation directly through Python scripts.

db/               # Directory used to store the SQLite database or related database files
__init__.py       # Marks the directory as a Python package
models.py         # Defines Django ORM models representing database tables
main.py           # Main Python script to interact with the Django ORM 
manage.py         # Django’s command-line utility for running management tasks 
settings.py       # Django configuration file for database, installed apps, and environment setup

Q1: Screendumps of working application.
